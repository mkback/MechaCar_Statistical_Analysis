### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
##### - Vehicle length and ground clearance have the most amound of random because the p-value is very close to 0. This means we can reject the null. The three other variables have a p-value greater than .05 so we cannot reject the null so we cannot rule out the randomness. 

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

##### - The slope of this linear model is not considered zero because the R value is .71. 

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

##### - The R-squared value of this linear regression is .7149 meaning about 71% of the time the model will predict the mpg correctly. This is a strong prediction, but there are probably more factors that can increase the effectiveness.
